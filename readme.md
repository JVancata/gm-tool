# What is this?
This is a UI of a tool used by game administrators.
## Why?
The official one was made back in 2006 and has many flaws that nobody is ever going to fix.
## Can I run it?
This repository contains only the electron user interface, it won't work without the TCP library that connects to the game server. It is not currently public yet. So the answer is no unless you write your own packet library.
## Commit history
The original commit history is unfortunately private due to the fact that it contained a lot of hard-coded personal information.
## Todo
Announce and monster spawn features are still missing.  
Reduce the bundle size
